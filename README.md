# What Happened

Tool belt to help explain what happened in your environment.

## Possible Features

This project is a combination of various small experiments, and may not end up amounting to anything!

### AWS to Honeycomb

- I would like an easy way to sync my VPC Flow logs & CloudTrail logs to Honeycomb.
- I would also like to easily sync these logs locally to my own machine.

This tool may become something that allows both these. Or it may not!
